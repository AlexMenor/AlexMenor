## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex and I'm passionate about computers since I was a kid. Starting my degree in **Computer Engineering** was a no-brainer. 

After a couple of years of focusing on fundamentals, I realized that I needed to get hands-on experience and got into entrepreneurship with a startup called *Pantala*. My goal there was to build a system from scratch so we could get a seed round, and we did it. 

In the middle of the last year of my degree, I had the opportunity to join *Bounsel*, an ambitious project that aims to end every pain in contract management with an all-in-one platform.

As the degree's final project, I went with *HÃ©roes*, an app to fight insecurity in the streets.

Finally, I decided to join *Internxt* as I firmly believe that privacy should be in the core of every kind of software.




I've always tried to be stack agnostic, emphasizing fundamentals and patterns that make great applications, but **these are the technologies I have more experience with:**

**Backend:**

- Node.js and Typescript with unopinionated (Express, Koa, Hapi) and opinionated (NestJS) frameworks
- Python with FastAPI, Django and Flask as frameworks
- Go

- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB

- Kafka
- Redis

- AWS
- GCP

- Github Actions
- CircleCI

- Docker
- Kubernetes

**Frontend**

- HTML/CSS/JS 
- React
- Vue

- Flutter 
- React Native



**I'm always eager to learn new things, not only about software and computers but also related to business and design.**
