## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 21 year old Computer Engineering student from Spain.

After 2 years studying my degree, I found in Web and Mobile Development my passion. More specifically: Server Side Programming, Cloud Computing and API Design.

Iâ€™m currently working at [Pantala](https://pantala.es) while I finish my degree, I'm also the lead of [DSC](https://developers.google.com/community/dsc) in Granada.

### Some of the technologies I enjoy the most are...

- Node.js and Typescript
- Golang
- Vue
- Flutter
